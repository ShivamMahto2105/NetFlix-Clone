# 🎬 Netflix Clone Landing Page

A **responsive Netflix-inspired landing page** built with **HTML & CSS**.  
I created this project while watching [**CodeWithHarry’s tutorial video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovKVqo-L2EM) on YouTube.  
It replicates the look and feel of Netflix's homepage with a hero section, responsive layout, FAQs, and footer.
